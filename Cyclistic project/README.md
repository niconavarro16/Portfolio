# CYCLISTICðŸš²
## What is Cyclistic?
A "fictional" bike-share company that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. 

It is believed that the company's future success will be achieved by maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I have to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, I will be able to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. 


Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

## 3 questions to solve
- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Process
* First, I downloaded the data from the last quarter (June, July, August, and September) in excel and proceeded to bind the four months together to be able to clean and analyze the data together.

  It is important to mention that I decided to work with R studio for completing this project.

```

##DOWNLOAD DATA
august2024_bike <- read.csv('202408-divvy-tripdata.csv')
july2024_bike <- read.csv('202407-divvy-tripdata.csv')
june2024_bike <- read.csv('202406-divvy-tripdata.csv')
may2024_bike <- read.csv('202405-divvy-tripdata.csv')

##DATA CLEANING
#I am binding the datasets because they have the same structure
four_months_data <- bind_rows(august2024_bike, july2024_bike, june2024_bike, may2024_bike)
```

* After this, I continued by cleaningðŸ§¹ the duplicates and changing some columns to have them more organized.
```
#removing duplicate rows
four_months_data <- unique(four_months_data)

#separate dates from time
  #Convert columns to POSIXct date-time format if they are not already
four_months_data$started_at <- as.POSIXct(four_months_data$started_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = "UTC")
four_months_data$ended_at <- as.POSIXct(four_months_data$ended_at, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = "UTC")
  #Extract date and time separately
four_months_data$started_date <- format(four_months_data$started_at, "%Y-%m-%d")
four_months_data$started_time <- format(four_months_data$started_at, "%H:%M:%S")
four_months_data$ended_date <- format(four_months_data$ended_at, "%Y-%m-%d")
four_months_data$ended_time <- format(four_months_data$ended_at, "%H:%M:%S")
```

* Calculating the ride lenghts in minutes, and adding the new columns **ride_length** and **day_of_week** 
```
  #calculate ride length in minutes
    #Apply difftime 
four_months_data$ride_length <- sapply(1:nrow(four_months_data), function(i) {
  tryCatch({
    round(difftime(four_months_data$ended_at[i], four_months_data$started_at[i], units = "mins"), 2)
  }, error = function(e) {
    NA  
  })
})


four_months_data$ride_length <- mapply(function(start, end) {
  tryCatch({
    round(difftime(end, start, units = "mins"), 2)
  }, error = function(e) {
    NA  # Return NA for problematic rows
  })
}, four_months_data$started_at, four_months_data$ended_at)

#Add column day of the week
four_months_data$day_of_week <- wday(four_months_data$started_at, label = FALSE, week_start = 1) # 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ...
```

* Creating pivot tables to then plot the results
1. Average ride length for members and casual riders
```
#Calculate the Average Ride Length for Members and Casual Riders
average_ride_length <- four_months_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual) %>%
  summarise(Average_Ride_Length = mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE))
```
2. Average ride length by day of the week for each user type
```
average_ride_length_by_day <- four_months_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(Average_Ride_Length = mean(ride_length, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = day_of_week, values_from = Average_Ride_Length, names_prefix = "Day_")
```
3. Number of Rides for Users by Day of the Week
```
rides_count_by_day <- four_months_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>%
  summarise(Count_of_Rides = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = day_of_week, values_from = Count_of_Rides)
```

## VisualizationðŸ“Š

1. Average Ride Length by User Type bar plot
```
ggplot(average_ride_length, aes(x = member_casual, y = Average_Ride_Length, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Average Ride Length by User Type", x = "User Type", y = "Average Ride Length (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

2. Average Ride Length by Day of the Week for Each User Type
``` 
  #Replacing numerical day of week with actual names for clarity
  day_names <- c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")
  long_data$day_of_week <- factor(day_names[long_data$day_of_week], levels = day_names)
  
  ggplot(long_data, aes(x = day_of_week, y = Average_Ride_Length, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), width = 0.7) +
    labs(title = "Average Ride Length by Day of Week and User Type",
         x = "Day of Week",
         y = "Average Ride Length (minutes)",
         fill = "User Type") +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +  # Customize colors if needed
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```
  
3. Number of Rides by Day of the Week for Each User Type Bar plot
```
  ggplot(long_rides_data, aes(x = day_of_week, y = Count_of_Rides, fill = member_casual)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +
    labs(title = "Number of Rides by Day of Week and User Type", x = "Day of Week", y = "Number of Rides") +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # Use comma to format numbers with commas for thousands
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("casual" = "red", "member" = "blue")) +  # Ensuring color consistency
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Improve x-label readability
```
